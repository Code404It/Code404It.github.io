My name is Jessica {Jessikah}. I am a single mother. 
I have 4 children, ages 18.5, 17, 15, & 14.
I have had a number of jobs and different careers. 
Right out of high school I went into the United States Army, where I was trained to be a Combat Medic. 
Post Army life, I tried my hand at nursing and shortly after that medical billing. 
Once I decided life in the medical field was not for me I tried my hand at personal training. 
I worked both for L.A. Fitness and for myself. 
While that was fun...it was not what I wanted to do forever. 
I then went into securites. 
I found myself working a ETrade, where I would study for my Series 7 and Series 63.
I then realized I hated math and being on the phone all day.
Somehow I managed to forget the part about being on the phone and went on to work at Comcast in their call center as an overnight manager. 
That did not last long at all.
The entreprenural spirit bit me hard. 
I became fully self employed, working as a virtual assistant, walking dog, and making t-shirts. 
This was where I wanted to be! 
That is until I got bored and realized it was almost 13 years later. 
While dropping my kids off at school one moring, something told me to go to school for bartending. 
So...I did and before I knew it, I was a real bartender. 
It was cool and the money was good, plus I got to travel becuase I was working for a caterer at the time.
One day while leaving the ATLANTA HUMANE SOCIETY I saw a cidery, I really liked cider...but more importantly I needed a place to celebrate my up coming birthday. 
I walked into the cidery. 
It wasn't open for business yet. 
I walked out with a job. 
Fast forward, I became the lead mixologist and later became the bar manager. 
After doing that for almost 4 years...it was time to go. 
On January 6, 2020 I turned in my key and applied for FLATIRON.
I am here now...because it's time for me to be in charge of my life again. 
This is just the pivot I need at this time. 
My kids call me Barbie...I hope you get it.
